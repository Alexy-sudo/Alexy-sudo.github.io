<h1>Notable achievements</h1><h3>Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve Classic Race Champion</h3>
<p class="tipycal">In my spare time at Wald’s Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of<br/> 588 mph top speed. Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human.<br/> Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.</p>

 <h3>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects</h3>
<p class="tipycal">During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects<br/> for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating<br/> Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of<br/> the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon<br/> torpedoes.</p>
